# Football Analytics Project
This repository contains code and examples for performing football analytics using Python. It is based on the concepts and techniques described in the book "Soccermatics" by David Sumpter. The goal of this repository is to provide practical implementations and demonstrations of football analytics methods, allowing users to explore and analyze various aspects of the game.

The code follows the video lectures from the Youtube channel 'Friends of Tracking'
